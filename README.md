## Capstone-II: Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factor Analysis
Final project for Coding Temple: Data Analyst Bootcamp

### Description
This is an analysis from the [Kaggle Cardiovascular Disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset) containing 70,000 patient's data. The goal was to wrangle and format the data as needed, create necessary UDF's for the modification/optimization of analysis, visualizing the relationships and trends withing the data, and refine conclusions.

### Files included
* Raw data in CSV
* Jupyter notebook file
* PDF with final presentation

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* R 
* Python
* Pandas, Jupyter

## Data Exploration overview
Initially I stuck to single variable analysis, evaluating if any single data point had a stronger correlation than others. After seeing minor increases and decreases, I took to digging in further to assess multivariable correlations. I was especially interested in the correlations between behavioral and obeserved data. As likely expected, there are no clear answers in major causes of cardiovascular data however this does lay interesting groundwork for future analysis questions and data gathering.
